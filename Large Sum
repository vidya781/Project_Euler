This is Problem 13 from the Project.

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

One could store the numbers in a file and operate on this file.

fh = open('LargeNumber.txt','r')
all_lines = fh.readlines()
fh.close()

def remove_n(all_lines):       # as the name =>, removes trailing '\n'
    res = [] 
    for sub in all_lines:
        res.append(sub.replace("\n",""))
    return res

new_list = remove_n(all_lines)

def generatelist(new_list):
    fresh_list =[]
    for item in new_list:
        fresh_list.append(int(item))
    return fresh_list

longlist = generatelist(new_list) # finetuning , and returning the numbers in a list 

big_number = sum(longlist)  # summing the list of numbers

# In order to extract the first 10 digits 

extracted = int(str(big_number)[:10])

print(extracted)
