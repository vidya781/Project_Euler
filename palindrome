A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.#

This is problem 4 from project Euler

def isPalindrome(n):
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]       # check is the number is a palindrome or not
    
def largest(lower,upper):
    for item in range(upper,lower,-1):
        for item in range(upper,lower,-1):
            if isPalindrome(x*y):
                return x*y
print largest(100,999)                  # return the largest number which is a palindrome
