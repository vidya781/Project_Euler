This is problem 21 of Project Euler

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000. Adapted from GFG.

A python program to evaluate sum of amicable numbers below n

import math 

N = 10000

# Function to return all amicable numbers 
def amicable(): 
  
    Sum = [0 for i in range(N)] 
      
    for i in range(1, N): 
        Sum[i] += 1
  
        for j in range(2, math.ceil(math.sqrt(i))):  
  
            # j is proper divisor of i 
            if (i % j == 0): 
                Sum[i] += j 
  
                # if i is not a perfect square 
                if (i // j != j): 
                    Sum[i] += i // j 
  
    s = set() 
    for i in range(2, N): 
        if(i != Sum[i] and Sum[i] < N and 
           i == Sum[Sum[i]] and i not in s and Sum[i] not in s): 
            s.add(i) 
            s.add(Sum[i]) 
  
    return s
