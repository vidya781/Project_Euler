# Problem 20 from Project Euler

n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

Approach : We can break this problem down into 2 parts:

a) Define a function for getting the factorial of a given number
b) Once the factorial is obtained, obtain individual digits and sum it up

def fact(n)
    if n < 0:
       print"No factorial defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0:
       print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
    else:
        for i in range(1,num+1):
            factorial = fact*i
            print("Factorial of ", num , "is", factorial)
 A = fact(n)
            
def sum_of_digits(A)
    new_list = [int(d) for d in str(A)]
    return sum(new_list)
