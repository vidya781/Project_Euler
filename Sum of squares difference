The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Problem 6 from the Euler Archive

Approach:

Basically it boils down to having two formulas one for the sum of the squares and one for the square of the sum which is larger.

Lets have two functions now :

def sum_of_squares(N):
    s1 = [N*N*(N+1)*(N+1)]/4
    return s1                           # A function to return sum of squares of the first N natural numbers
    
def squares_of_sums(N):
    s2 = [N*(N+1)*(2N+1)]/6
    return s2                            # A function to return squares of the sums of the first N natural numbers
    
def difference(s1,s2):
    return s2-s1                        # return the difference of the numbers
